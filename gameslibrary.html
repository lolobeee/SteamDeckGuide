        <h2 id="5.4">5.4 Navigating the Games Library</h2>
        
        <br/>
        As mentioned in 5.1 above, to access the Games Library:
        <ol>
            <li>Click the <span class="button">Steam</span> button.</li>
            <li>Go to <span class="button">Library</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="library.png" alt="Library menu on Steam Deck" class="wide"></p>
        <p>This will take you to the "Great on Deck" page of your Games Library.</p>
        <img src="gameslibrary.jpg" alt="Games LIbrary" class="wide">
        <p>When a game is considered, "Great on Deck," that means that the experience of playing it on the Steam Deck meets certain standards and becomes Verified.<br></p>
        
        <p>Verified Games have a <img src="verified.png" alt="Verified Icon" class="inline"> next to their name to show that:
            <ul><li>They have all of their functionality accessible when using the default controller configuration</li>
                <li>They show Steam Deck controller icons</li>
                <li>Their in-game interface text is legible on the Steam Deck</li>
                <li>Their default graphics configuration performs well on the Steam Deck</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can still play games that are not Verified (indicated with an orange "i" icon), but it could be difficult to play that game because of its controls or the interface is hard to read. These games are considered Playable.<br>
                Some games are too difficult to play on the Steam Deck, and so these are called Unsupported and are indicated with a grey circle with a slash through it.<br>
                If a game has a question mark within a dotted-outline circle, that means Steam has not gotten enough data yet to determine a game's Verified status.<br>
                Steam utilizes its users to evaluate if games are easily playable and worthy of the Verified status. Occasionally, when closing a game, the Steam Deck will ask you if yur experience with it matches whether it is Verified, Playable, or Unsupported.
            </p>
        </p>
        
        <p>To see all of your games, select the <span class="button">All Games</span> section within the Games Library by pressing <span class="button">R1</span>. <br>
            To go back to the left category within the Games Library, press <span class="button">L1</span>.<br>
            <img src="allgames.jpg" alt="Play game button for 'Core Keeper'" class="wide"><br>
            You can also quickly see all of your installed games by going to the <span class="button">Installed</span> section of the Games Library.<br>
            The <span class="button">Non-Steam</span> section within the Games Library is for any games you have on your Steam Deck that you did not get through Steam.<br> 
            The <span class="button">Soundtracks</span> section is where any game soundtracks you have purchased as DLC (Downloadable Content) will appear.<br>
            The Games Library is sorted alphabetically automatically. When navigating through your games, press <span class="button">R2</span> and <span class="button">L2</span> to move quickly between letters of the alphabet.
        </p>
        <p>You can press <span class="button">Y</span> to sort your games by other criteria, such as "Friends Playing," "Hours Played," "Last Played," etc.</p>
        <img src="sort.jpg" alt="Sort Fuction in the Game Library." class="wide"><br>
        <p>You can press <span class="button">X</span> to filter out games based on criteria such as Verified status, how many players (i.e. single-player, multiplayer), play state, hardware support, features, genre, and if one of your friends plays the game.</p>
        <img src="filter.jpg" alt="Filter function in the Game Library." class="wide"><br>
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="5.5">5.5 Game Page Interface</h2>
        
        <p>Selecting any game within your game library brings you to its page within your Steam Deck:</p>
        <img src="among.jpg" alt="Play game button for 'Core Keeper'" class="wide"><br>
        <p>This will take you to the game's "Activity" section. From here, you can view your recent activity within the game. This allows you to post something about the game to your Steam Friends.<br>
            Also within this section, you can see a list of updates about the game from the developers.
        </p>
        <p>The "Your Stuff" section of a game's page will show you all of your achievements, Steam Trading Cards, DLC, screenshots, and any reviews you've written for the game.<br>
            The Community section will show you all Community Content for the game: guides, artwork, posts, etc.
