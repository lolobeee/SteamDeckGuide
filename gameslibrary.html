        <h2 id="5.1">5.1 Verified Status</h2>
        <p>Before you purchase and/or install a game onto the Steam Deck, it is important to know about a term called <span class="button">Verified</span>.</p>
        <p>When a game's compatibility is considered <span class="button">Verified</span> that means that the experience of playing it on the Steam Deck meets certain standards.</p>        
        <p>Verified Games have a <img src="verified.png" alt="Verified Icon" class="inline"> next to their name to show that:</p>
        <ul><li>They have all of their functionality accessible when using the default controller configuration</li>
            <li>They show Steam Deck controller icons</li>
            <li>Their in-game interface text is legible on the Steam Deck</li>
            <li>Their default graphics configuration performs well on the Steam Deck</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some games are trickier to play because of their controls or the interface is hard to read. These games are not Verified, but considered <span class="button">Playable</span> and are indicated with this symbol: <img src="playable.png" alt="Playable Icon" class="inline"></p>
        <p>Some games are too difficult to play on the Steam Deck, and so these are called <span class="button">Unsupported</span> and are indicated by this symbol:<img src="unsupportedicon.png" alt="Unsupported Icon" class="inline"></p>
        <p>If a game has a <img src="unknownicon.png" alt="Unknown Icon" class="inline"> that means Steam has not gotten enough data yet to determine a game's Verified status. The compatibility of these games is considered <span class="button">Unknown</span>.</p>
        <p>Steam utilizes its users' input to evaluate if games are easily playable and worthy of the Verified status. Occasionally, when closing a game, the Steam Deck will ask you if your experience with it matches whether it is Verified, Playable, or Unsupported.</p>
