        </ol>
        <p>From this menu, you can change the game's individual keybindings (which buttons do what while in game.)</p>

            <p>Going to <span class="button">Community Layouts</span> within a game's Controller Settings allows you to view Layouts that others in the Steam Community have made, which can save you time as someone else has probably optimized the controls already.</p>
