        <h2 id="6.1">6.1 Accessing the Steam Store</h2>
        <p>To access the Steam Store, press the <span class="button">Steam Button</span> and select <span class="button">Store</span>.</p>

        <h2 id="6.2">6.2 Great on Deck</h2>
        <p>When you select the Steam Store, it brings you to a page called "Great on Deck."<br><br>
            As mentioned in <a href="gameslibrary.html">Section 5.4 Navigating the Games Library</a>, "Great on Deck" means that the experience of playing it on the Steam Deck meets certain standards and becomes Verified.<br><br>
            Verified Games have a green check mark next to their name to show that:
            <ul><li>they have all of their functionality accessible when using the default controller configuration</li>
                <li>they show Steam Deck controller icons</li>
                <li>their in-game interface text is legible on the Steam Deck</li>
                <li>their default graphics configuration performs well on the Steam Deck</li></ul>
                You can still play games that are Unverified (indicated with an orange "i" icon), but it could be difficult to play that game because of its controls or the interface is hard to read. These games are considered Playable.<br>
                Some games are too difficult to play on the Steam Deck, and so these are called Unsupported and are indicated with a grey circle with a slash through it.<br>
                If a game has a question mark within a dotted-outline circle, that means Steam has not gotten enough data yet to determine a game's Verified status.<br>
                Steam utilizes its users to evaluate if games are easily playable and worthy of the Verified status. Occasionally, when closing a game, the Steam Deck will ask you if your experience with it matches whether it is Verified, Playable, or Unsupported. </p>
                
                <p>The "Great on DecK" page within the Steam Store shows only games that are Verified.</p>
                <img src="greatondeck.jpg" alt="The Great on Deck section of the Steam Store." width="600" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
                <p>Within this page, it also shows the games that are currently popular to play on the Steam Deck. <br>
                    The rest of the page is split into different genres of games (for example, Action, Casual, RPG, etc.)</p>
                    <hr>
                    
                    <h2 id="6.3">6.3 Store Home</h2>
                    <p>The "Store Home" page of the Steam Deck is very similar to the Steam Store Page on the Desktop version of Steam.<br>
                        Here, you can browse all games, not just those that are Verified.<br>
                        You can see what games are featured, recommended, and brose by category (similar to genre). Steam will also give you recommended games based on others you have already played.<br>
                        There are community recommendations, games your friends are playing, games on sale, and much more.</p>

                    <h2 id="6.4">6.4 Categories</h2>
                    <p>Here, you can browse games by their Category.<br>
                            It is sorted first by genre, like "Action," "Adventure," etc. Then, more specifically within that genre. For example, the category of "First-Person Shooter" is within the "Action" genre.<br>
                            The first option of each genre is to show all of those games within that genre (except for "Special Sections".)</p>

    <h2 id="6.5">6.5 Wishlist</h2>
        <p>The Wishlist page is where all games that you have selected to put on your wishlist will appear.</p>
        <p>Something on the Steam Deck that is different from the Wishlist on the Desktop version of Steam is if the game is Verified or not.</p>
