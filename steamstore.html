        <h1>5. The Steam Store</h1>
        <p>Just like on the PC version of Steam, the Steam Store on the Steam Deck is where you can purchase more games.</p>
        <p>This section goes over how to access the Steam Store, purchase games, and more!</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="5.1">5.1 Access the Steam Store</h2>
        <p>To access the Steam Store:
            <ol>
                <li>Press the <span class="button">Steam Button</span>.</li> 
                <li>Select <span class="button">Store</span>.</li>

        <h2 id="5.2">5.2 Search the Steam Store</h2>
        <p>To search for games within the Steam Store, go to the <span class="button">Search Steam</span> page of the store.</p>
        <img src="searchstoremenu.jpg" alt="Search Steam page of the Steam Store." class="wide"><br class="caption">
        <span class="caption">Figure 5.2: The Search Steam page.</span><br>
        <p>From there, you can type in keywords for your search.</p>
        <p>Steam will list titles based on the <span class="button">Sort By</span> criteria as well as your preferences.</p>
        <img src="searchcats.jpg" alt="An example of a search within the Steam Store for relevance to the phrase, 'cats.'" class="wide"><br class="caption">
        <span class="caption">Figure 5.3: An example of a search within the Steam Store for relevance to the phrase, "cats."</span><br>
        <p>For each game listed in your search results, Steam will show you its price, release date, and overall rating based on reviews in the Steam Store:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li><img src="thumbsup.png" alt="Blue thumbs up icon." class="inline"> indicates positive reviews</li>
            <li><img src="mixed.png" alt="Yellow tilde icon." class="inline"> indicates mixed reviews</li>
            <li><img src="thumbsdown.png" alt="Red thumbs down icon." class="inline"> indicates negative reviews</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also see if the games in your results are Verified based on their icon (more on Verified Games in Section 5.3).</p>
        <p>Any games that you already own will show up with this symbol: <img src="inlibraryicon.png" alt="The three-lined icon that means you already own the game." class="inline"> to indicate that they are already in your library.</p>
        <p>You can sort your search by other criteria besides relevancy by clicking the drop-down list next to <span class="button">Sort By</span>. You can sort by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Release Date</li>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Lowest Price</li>
            <li>Highest Price</li>
            <li>User Reviews</li>
            <li>Steam Deck Compatibility Review Date</li>

        <h2 id="5.3">5.3 Verified Games</h2>
        <p>As you get familiar with the Steam Library and the Steam Store, it is important to know about a term called <span class="button">Verified</span>.</p>
        <p>When a game's compatibility is considered Verified that means that the experience of playing it on the Steam Deck meets certain standards.</p>        
        <p>Verified Games have a <img src="verified.png" alt="Verified Icon" class="inline"> next to their name to show that:</p>
        <ul><li>They have all of their functionality accessible when using the default controller configuration</li>
            <li>They show Steam Deck controller icons</li>
            <li>Their in-game interface text is legible on the Steam Deck</li>
            <li>Their default graphics configuration performs well on the Steam Deck</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some games are trickier to play because of their controls or the interface is hard to read. These games are not Verified, but considered Playable and are indicated with this symbol: <img src="playable.png" alt="Playable Icon" class="inline"></p>
        <p>Some games are too difficult to play on the Steam Deck, and so these are called Unsupported and are indicated by this symbol:<img src="unsupportedicon.png" alt="Unsupported Icon" class="inline"></p>
        <p>If a game has a <img src="unknownicon.png" alt="Unknown Icon" class="inline"> that means Steam has not gotten enough data yet to determine a game's Verified status. The compatibility of these games is considered Unknown.</p>
        <p>Steam utilizes its users' input to evaluate if games are easily playable and worthy of the Verified status. Occasionally, when closing a game, the Steam Deck will ask you if your experience with it matches whether it is Verified, Playable, or Unsupported.</p>

        <h2 id="5.4">5.4 Wishlist a Game</h2>
        <p>The <span class="button">Wishlist</span> page is where all games that you have selected to put on your Wishlist will appear.</p>
        <img src="wishlist.jpg" alt="The Wishlist section of the Steam Store." class="wide"><br class="caption">
        <span class="caption">Figure 5.6: The Wishlist page.</span><br>
        <p>To put a game onto your Wishlist:</p>
