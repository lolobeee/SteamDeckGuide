        <h2 id="6.2">6.2 How to Buy a Game</h2>
        <p>To buy a game on the Steam Deck, go to the Steam Store.</p>
        <p>When you go to the Steam Store, it brings you first to a page called <span class="button">Great on Deck</span>. The Great on Deck page within the Steam Store shows only games that are <span class="button">Verified</span>. For more about the Verified status and Steam Deck compatibility, please go to <a href="gameslibrary.html#5.1">Section 5.1 Verified Status</a>.</p>
        <img src="greatondeck.jpg" alt="The Great on Deck page of the Steam Store." class="wide"><br class="caption">
        <span class="caption">Figure 6.2: The Great on Deck page of the Steam Store</span><br>       
        <p>Within this page, it also shows the games that are currently popular to play on the Steam Deck.</p>
        <p>The rest of the page is split into different <span class="button">Categories</span> of games (for example, <span class="button">Action, Casual, RPG,</span> etc.)</p>
        <p>Find a game you wish to purchase either from browsing the categories or using the <span class="button">Search Steam</span> section of the Store (for more on how to do that, see <a href="#6.6">Section 6.6 Searching the Steam Store</a>.)</p>
        <p>On a game's <span class="button">Store Page</span>, you can see its Verified status at a glance under the <span class="button">Steam Deck Compatability</span> heading. You can also click the <span class="button">Learn More</span> button to see why it has been given this status.</p>
        <p>Under a game's Store Page banner, you can see more details about the game such as publisher, publish date, etc.</p>
        <p>To purchase the game, simply click on the <span class="button">Add to Cart</span> button.</p>

        <span class="caption">Figure 6.3: The Store Page for "Sea of Stars."</span>
        <p>You can keep shopping or press <span class="button">View My Cart</span> to finishing checking out.</p>
        <p>Once purchased, you will be given the option to install your game right away. If you do not install right away and want to install later, you can do so by finding your game within your Steam Library and selecting <span class="button">Install</span>. For more on this, see <a href="gameslibrary.html#5.2">Section 5.2 Installing Games</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="6.3">6.3 Store Home</h2>
        <p>The <span class="button">Store Home</span> page of the Steam Deck is very similar to the Steam Store on the Desktop version of Steam.</p>
        <p>Here, you can browse all games, not just those that are Verified.</p>
        <p>You can see what games are <span class="button">Featured</span> and <span class="button">Recommended</span> and can browse by <span class="button">Category</span>.</p>
        <p>There are <span class="button">Community Recommendations</span>, games your friends are playing, games on sale, and much more.</p>

        <h2 id="6.4">6.4 Categories</h2>
        <p>The next page over from the Store Home is <span class="button">Categories</span>. Here, you can browse games by their category.</p>
        <p>It is sorted first by large Categories, like <span class="button">Action</span>, <span class="button">Adventure</span>, etc. Then, more specifically within that Category. For example, the Category of <span class="button">First-Person Shooter</span> is within the <span class="button">Action</span> Category.</p>

        <h2 id="6.5">6.5 Wishlist</h2>
        <p>The <span class="button">Wishlist</span> page is where all games that you have selected to put on your <span class="button">Wishlist</span> will appear.</p>
        <img src="wishlist.jpg" alt="The Wishlist section of the Steam Store." class="wide"><br class="caption">
        <span class="caption">Figure 6.6: The Wishlist page.</span><br>
        <p>To put a game onto your Wishlist, find its page within the Steam Store (see the next section, <a href="#6.6">Section 6.6 Searching the Steam Store</a> for help on how to find games.)</p>
        <p>Scroll down in the game's page until you find the <span class="button">Add to Your Wishlist</span> button and select it. Now, that game will appear in your Wishlist, allowing you to get notifications about when it goes on sale, or when it is released if it is not out yet.</p>

        <span class="caption">Figure 6.7: The Add to Your Wishlist button.</span><br>
        <p>If you do not want to add a game to your Wishlist, but still get notified about any updates, you can select the <span class="button">Follow</span> button. Alternatively, if you do not want this game to show up on your <span class="button">Recommended</span> section of the Steam Store, you can select the <span class="button">Ignore</span> button. The <span class="button">Flag</span> button allows you to report a game, if you believe something about it is illegal, offensive, etc.</p>

        <p>For each game listed in your search results, Steam will show you its price, release date, and overall rating based on reviews in the Steam Store:</p>

        <p>You can also see if the games in your results are Verified based on their icon. For more information about Verified status, see the earlier section, <a href="#5.1">Section 5.1 Verified Status</a>.</p>
