        <h2 id="2.1">2.1 Controls Overview</h2>
        <p>The main controls of the Steam Deck are the <span class="button">Thumbsticks</span>, <span class="button">Trackpads</span>, and <span class="button">ABXY</span> buttons.</p>
        <p>These are all located on the front of the Steam Deck.</p>

        <p>To navigate within the menus on the Steam Deck, you can use any of the following:</p>
        <ul><li><span class="button">Left Thumbstick</span></li>
            <li><span class="button">D-Pad</span></li>
            <li><span class="button">Left Trackpad</span></li>
            <li><span class="button">Touchscreen</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To select, press the <span class="button">A Button</span>.</p>
        <p>To unselect, or go back, press the <span class="button">B Button</span>.</p>
        <p>To press <span class="button">L3</span> or <span class="button">R3</span>, you press down on their respective <span class="button">Thumbstick</span>.</p>
        <p>The <span class="button">Menu</span>, <span class="button">Steam</span>, and <span class="button">View</span> buttons all are primarily used for bringing up menus. The <span class="button">Menu</span> and <span class="button">View</span> buttons are also sometimes referred to as "Start" and "Select." For more about the <span class="button">Steam</span> button and the "Steam Menu", see <a href="steammenu.html">Section 4: The Steam Menu.</a></p> 
        <p>The <span class="button">Quick Access</span> button can be used to quickly change settings such as brightness and audio. For more on this, see <a href="quickaccess.html">Section 10: Quick Access Menu</a></p>
        <p>The Steam Deck's speakers are located on its front, as well as two microphones located above the 7" touchscreen. </p>
        <p>Other commonly used buttons include the <span class="button">R1</span>, <span class="button">R2</span>, <span class="button">L1</span>, and <span class="button">L2</span> buttons. These are located on the top sides of the Steam Deck and are known as "trigger" buttons. Within menus, they can generally be used for switching between menu pages and flipping through lists more quickly.</p> 
        <p>Every game will have different control bindings. To learn more about how to change these, see <a href="gameslibrary.html#5.3">Section 5.3: "Game Menu"</a>.</p>

        <p>The <span class="button">Power</span> button is located at the top of the Steam Deck. It can be used to put your Steam Deck into sleep mode. For more on how to shut your Steam Deck down completely, see <a href="steammenu.html#4.9">Section 4.9: Power</a>.</p>
        <p>The Steam Deck uses a 45W USB-C charger, and its charging port is located at the top of the Steam Deck near the <span class="button">Power</span> button.</p>
        <p>The <span class="button">Volume</span> buttons are located at the top of the Steam Deck. The Steam Deck has a headphone jack for plugging in headphones. It also allows for Bluetooth headphones. For more on Bluetooth, see <a href="settingsmenu.html">Section 11.TBD Bluetooth</a>.</p>
        <p>On the back of the Steam Deck, there is a microSD card slot. For more information about how to add a microSD card to your Steam Deck for more memory, please see this guide from Polygon.com: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/23562828/steam-deck-best-sd-cards-how-to-install-storage-format-speed" target="_blank">"How to Install and Format an SD Card on Steam Deck"</a>.</p>

        <p>Some games will require the use of the four buttons on the back known as <span class="button">R4</span>, <span class="button">R5</span>, <span class="button">L4</span>, and <span class="button">L5</span>. These are flat, square buttons that act similarly to the other trigger buttons.</p>
        <p>When prompted to type in information, the "Keyboard Screen" will appear.</p>
        <p>You can type by using the <span class="button">Left Thumbstick</span>, <span class="button">D-Pad</span>, or the <span class="button">Right Trackpad</span> to navigate and <span class="button">A</span> to select a key. Alternatively, you can use the touchscreen to select keys.</p>
        <p>There are several shortcuts that will be displayed on the keyboard (for example, <span class="button">X</span> can be used for <span class="button">Backspace</span>.)</p>
